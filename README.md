## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or higher
- A GitHub account
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with the `user:follow` scope

### Option 1: Build from source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jvcByte/gh_followers.git
   cd gh_followers
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o github-followers ./cmd
   ```

### Option 2: Install via Go
```bash
go install github.com/jvcByte/gh_followers@latest
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with the `user:follow` scope
3. Copy the token for configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root or set environment variables:

```env
# Required
GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token

# Optional (with defaults)
WORKER_COUNT=1      # Number of concurrent workers (default: 1)
QUEUE_SIZE=3        # Size of the worker queue (default: 3)
TIME_DELAY_MS=2000  # Delay between API calls in milliseconds (default: 2000)
```

> **Note**: You can copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.

## 🚦 Usage

The tool provides two main commands: `follow` and `unfollow`.

### Follow Command

Follow followers of a specific user who don't already follow you:

```bash
# Basic usage - follow followers of 'username' who don't follow you
./github-followers follow username

# Skip confirmation prompt
./github-followers follow username --force
./github-followers follow username -f
```

### Unfollow Command

Unfollow users who don't follow you back:

```bash
# Show users who don't follow you back (dry run)
./github-followers unfollow

# Actually unfollow users who don't follow you back without confirm
./github-followers unfollow --f
./github-followers unfollow --force
```

### Unfollow Command

Unfollow users who don't follow you back:

```bash
# Basic usage - unfollow users who don't follow you back
./gh_followers unfollow

# Skip confirmation prompt
./gh_followers unfollow --force
./gh_followers unfollow -f
```

**Example workflow:**
1. Tool fetches your followers list
2. Tool fetches your following list
3. Identifies users you follow who don't follow you back
4. Shows the list and asks for confirmation (unless `--force` is used)
5. Unfollows the users concurrently with rate limiting

### Command-Line Flags

Both commands support the following flags:

- `--force, -f`: Skip interactive confirmation prompt (use with caution)
- `--help, -h`: Show help information

### Help Command

```bash
# Show general help
./gh_followers --help

# Show help for specific commands
./gh_followers follow --help
./gh_followers unfollow --help
```

## Configuration Options

### Worker Pool Settings

- **WORKER_COUNT**: Number of concurrent workers for API calls (default: 1)
  - Higher values = faster execution but more API rate limit pressure
  - Recommended: 1-5 for most use cases

- **QUEUE_SIZE**: Size of the task queue (default: 3)
  - Buffer size for pending tasks
  - Should be >= WORKER_COUNT

- **TIME_DELAY_MS**: Delay between API calls in milliseconds (default: 2000)
  - Helps avoid GitHub API rate limits
  - Lower values = faster execution but higher risk of rate limiting
  - Recommended: 1000-3000ms

### Example Configurations

**Conservative (safe for large operations):**
```env
WORKER_COUNT=1
QUEUE_SIZE=3
TIME_DELAY_MS=3000
```

**Balanced:**
```env
WORKER_COUNT=2
QUEUE_SIZE=3
TIME_DELAY_MS=2000
```

## Examples


### Using environment variables
```bash
# Set token and username via environment
export GITHUB_USERNAME="myusername"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export WORKER_COUNT=2
export TIME_DELAY_MS=1500

./gh_followers unfollow
```

## Architecture

The project is organized into the following components:

- **`main.go`**: Application entry point
- **`cmd/`**: Cobra CLI commands
  - `root.go`: Root command setup
  - `follow.go`: Follow command implementation
  - `unfollow.go`: Unfollow command implementation
- **`internal/`**: Internal packages
  - `config/`: Configuration management with Viper
  - `git_hub_manager/`: GitHub API client wrapper
  - `worker/`: Worker pool for concurrent processing
  - `helper/`: Utility functions

## Security

- Your GitHub token is only used to authenticate with the GitHub API
- The token requires only the `user:follow` scope - no access to repositories or other data
- Tokens are loaded from environment variables, never hardcoded
- Never share your `.env` file or commit it to version control
- The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` by default

## Rate Limiting

GitHub API has rate limits:
- 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated requests
- Each follow/unfollow operation uses 1 API call
- The tool includes built-in delays (configurable via `TIME_DELAY_MS`)
- Use conservative settings for large operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Authentication failed" error:**
- Verify your `GITHUB_TOKEN` is correct and has `user:follow` scope
- Check that the token hasn't expired

**"Rate limit exceeded" error:**
- Increase `TIME_DELAY_MS` value
- Reduce `WORKER_COUNT`
- Wait for the rate limit to reset (1 hour)

**"User not found" error:**
- Verify the username exists and is public
- Some users may have restricted follower lists
