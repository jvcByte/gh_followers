## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or higher
- GitHub account
- GitHub Personal Access Token with `user:follow` scope

### Option 1: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jvcByte/gh_followers.git
cd gh_followers
go build -o github-followers ./cmd
```

### Option 2: Install via Go

```bash
go install github.com/jvcByte/gh_followers/cmd@latest
```

## Configuration

### GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with the `user:follow` scope
3. Copy the token

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required
GH_USERNAME=your_github_username
GH_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

# Optional (defaults shown)
WORKER_COUNT=1      # Concurrent workers (1-5 recommended)
QUEUE_SIZE=3        # Task queue buffer size
TIME_DELAY_MS=2000  # Delay between API calls (1000-3000 recommended)
```

> Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.

## Usage

### Follow Command

Follow followers of a specific user who don't already follow you:

```bash
# Follow up to 5 followers of torvalds
./github-followers follow torvalds --limit 5

# Follow without confirmation
./github-followers follow username --force

# Follow with custom limit
./github-followers follow username --limit 10
```

**Flags:**
- `--limit, -l`: Maximum number of users to follow (default: 0 = no limit)
- `--force, -f`: Skip confirmation prompt

### Unfollow Command

Unfollow users who don't follow you back:

```bash
# Show users and confirm before unfollowing
./github-followers unfollow

# Unfollow without confirmation
./github-followers unfollow --force
```

**Flags:**
- `--force, -f`: Skip confirmation prompt

### Help

```bash
./github-followers --help
./github-followers follow --help
./github-followers unfollow --help
```

## Automated Workflows

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated daily operations:

### Daily Follow Workflow

Automatically follows 1 user from each of 30 top developer accounts daily (30 users/day total):

- **Schedule**: Daily at 8 AM UTC
- **Trigger**: Manual via workflow_dispatch
- **Log**: Maintains `follow-log.json` with daily activity

### Daily Unfollow Workflow

Automatically unfollows users who don't follow you back (with 3-day grace period):

- **Schedule**: Daily at 9 AM UTC (1 hour after follow workflow)
- **Logic**: Only unfollows users followed 3+ days ago who haven't followed back
- **Trigger**: Manual via workflow_dispatch (with optional dry-run mode)

### Setup for Automated Workflows

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Add secrets:
   - `GH_USERNAME`: Your GitHub username
   - `GH_TOKEN`: Your personal access token with `user:follow` scope
4. Enable GitHub Actions in your fork

```

## Security

- Tokens require only `user:follow` scope (no repo access)
- Tokens loaded from environment variables only
- Never commit `.env` to version control (included in `.gitignore`)
- Use GitHub secrets for automated workflows

## Rate Limiting

GitHub API limits:
- 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated requests
- Each follow/unfollow = 1 API call
- Built-in configurable delays via `TIME_DELAY_MS`

**Recommended settings for large operations:**
```env
WORKER_COUNT=1
TIME_DELAY_MS=3000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed
- Verify `GH_TOKEN` is correct and has `user:follow` scope
- Check token hasn't expired

### Rate Limit Exceeded
- Increase `TIME_DELAY_MS` value
- Reduce `WORKER_COUNT` to 1
- Wait for rate limit reset (1 hour)

### Command Hangs on Large Accounts
- Use `--limit` flag to fetch only needed followers
- Example: `./github-followers follow torvalds --limit 10`
